* *I used to work for "Hewlett Packard Enterprise" as a Customer Engineer and after 6 years decided to leave a company to study CS at OSU. It was a hard decision for me but I wanted to extend my knowledge beyond installing troubleshooting enterprise hardware and software. I want to participate in development of hardware (servers, storage etc.), hardware microcode, and software.*
